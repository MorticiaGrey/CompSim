# CompSim
Simputer emulator

Compsim is an attempt to code a library capable of granular and realistic emulations of computers. The design is based on my background in operating
system development and is meant to be as reconfigurable as possible, even in runtime.

There are of course, certain restraints. Firstly performance is a consideration depending on hardware, and beyond that there may be limitations
in the technologies involved in the emulation which place further strain on performance. However, on a scale which is not excessively large,
the game should run fine.

Another thing to be noted is that my design philosophy in regards to this project is very similar to that of a library. This code is meant
to be expandable, and if you see areas where you'd like to iterate on my ideas and design I very much encourage you to. It is after all
possible to implement the data structures and utility functions without implementing the default entry point. So just have fun with it!
