Immediate -
  - Establish gamedata [done]
  - Data serialization (think about storing as numbers for security, later) [done]
  - Machine/disk integration (saving machine data, filesystem abstraction, etc.) [done]
  - Establish lua integration (early so it's built into coming systems already) [done]
  - Basic system call library for machines to interact with outside IO [working on it]
  - Events (Needed for IO, especially key presses) [done]
  - Logging (like tracking everything that happens, do early so I don't have to add in later) [done]
  - Machine/GUI integration (predefined elements, html display, lua gui library)
  - Terminal (built in lua using a static device controlling gui)
  - Dynamic device support
  - Networking (pretty simple, pass data through event system. Try not to make java code fancy)
  - Custom tables that can be shared from inside machine
  - Audio support (stretch goal, not a high priority)
  - Default gameplay scenarios (prebuilt stuff to do)
  - Helper application to speed scenario production (generate files, run game, etc.)
  - Separate app to select and set up scenarios (very low priority, dependant)
